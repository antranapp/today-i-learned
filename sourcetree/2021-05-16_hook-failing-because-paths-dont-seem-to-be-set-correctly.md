# Hook failing because paths don't seem to be set correctly

## Solution 1

https://github.com/typicode/husky/issues/390

`Install Command Line Tools` from Source Tree

Then from your terminal run `stree` it works for me!

## Solution 2
If you are on Mac than try to open sourcetree with this command

```
open /Applications/SourceTree.app/Contents/MacOS/SourceTree
```
