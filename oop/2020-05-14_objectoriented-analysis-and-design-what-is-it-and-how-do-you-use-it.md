# Object-Oriented Analysis and Design: What is it and how do you use it?

Most developers are well-aware of the concepts of `object-oriented development`, but those same concepts originate from a broader approach to the entire software development life cycle known as `object-oriented analysis and design` (`OOAD`). `OOAD` is a technical method of analyzing and designing an application based on that systemâ€™s `object models` (the logical components of the system that interact with one another).

## What is Object-Oriented Analysis?

`OOA` is an iterative stage of analysis, which takes place during the software development life cycle, that aims to model the functional requirements of the software while remaining completely independent of any potential implementation requirements.

To accomplish this goal, a typical OOA phase consists of five stages:

- Find and define the objects.
- Organize the objects.
- Describe how the objects interact with one another.
- Define the external behavior of the objects.
- Define the internal behavior of the objects.

## What is Object-Oriented Design?

The process of `object-oriented design` is really just an extension of the `object-oriented analysis` process that preceded it, except with a critical caveat: the consideration and implementation of `constraints`. 

Put another way, the `OOD` process takes the theoretical concepts and ideas planned out during the `OOA` stage, and tries to find a way to design and tangibly implement them, usually via code using whatever language and platforms the development team has settled upon. If `OOA` is the what, then `OOD` is the how.
